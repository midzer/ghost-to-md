title: "A call for new music: FAWN Chamber Creative"
---

Composers, this one's for you!

In its 2016/17 season, [FAWN Chamber Creative](/scene/people/fawn-chamber-creative/) will present the fourth edition of their *Synesthesia Series*, which unites Canadian composers with artists of various performance disciplines. *Synesthesia IV* will be a unique process, through which FAWN will find the next composer for their *Opera Series*. The selected composer will work with FAWN to create a new *ballet-lyrique*, "a traditional French-form loved in the 16th and 17th-centuries, which we will bring to the 21st century stage."

Composers interested in submitting should send a **1-5 minute recording** of their work, plus the corresponding score, a bio, résumé, and a short summary of their compositional interests. The instrumentation is specific, and works must be include some or all of: **tenor (voice), cello, electronics, percussion, and acoustic guitar.**

The deadline for submissions is **March 18, 2016**, and the works will be subject to a secret audience vote on May 16.

Interested composers, it looks like you've found your next project! We're looking forward to hearing the work.
