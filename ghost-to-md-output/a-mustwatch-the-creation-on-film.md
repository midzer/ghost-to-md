title: "A must-watch: The Creation on film"

If you're suffering from a bit of overdose on Handel's *Messiah* or Bach's *Christmas Oratorio*, [Rambert](http://www.rambert.org.uk/home/) has a well-timed offering of something a little different. 

Their production of *The Creation* is a new danced version of Haydn's oratorio, with choreography by Rambert Artistic Director Mark Baldwin, and design by artist Pablo Bronstein. Their *Creation* first went up at Garsington Opera's Wormsley Estate in July 2016, and and saw its London premiere at Sadlers Wells in November. 

Happily, the London premiere of [Rambert's *The Creation*](http://www.rambert.org.uk/home/) was captured on film, directed by award-winning dance filmmaker Ross MacGibbon; starting today, [the film is available to stream online.](http://www.rambert.org.uk/explore/videos/the-creation-film/)

The filmed performance, conducted by Rambert Music Director Paul Hoskins, features over 40 dancers, along with the Rambert Orchestra, the BBC Singers, and soloists Sarah Tynan, James Gilchrist, and Neal Davies.

Rambert's choreographed version of *The Creation* is the latest in what we think is a thrilling trend in oratorio interpretation. Even better: you can watch it from your comfiest couch.
