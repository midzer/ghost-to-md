title: Advice for Young Musicians, from Young Agents

<h2>Being a Good Colleague</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Allison</strong>: "There are a lot of amazing musicians everywhere, but being easy to work with will get you hired over other people every time. Whether it's for chamber performances, solo recitals, or orchestras, I've seen personality hired over ability (when the difference in ability is minimal) on many occasions."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Alia</strong>: "Getting in the door sometimes is a lot easier than getting hired back if it was a bad experience for the people that surrounded you and are supporting you and helping you have a good performance. If you've been working with a lot of people and word gets around that you're a diva, or that you're difficult and don't listen to the director, or you're just not a nice person to your colleagues, then that could have an adverse effect on your career."
</p>
<h2>Business and Networking</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Allison</strong>: "Updating their resume, getting new headshots, putting a press kit together, having coffee with a mentor, or thinking about programming possibilities, all of these aspects are necessary on a regular basis for succeeding as a musician in addition to practicing. Many young musicians are caught when they need these items and they are not ready, and then lose opportunities as a result."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Alia</strong>: "Don't be afraid to network. I think that a lot of people, not just artists, they hear that word and they just want to go run and hide, and never come out. And that's a shame, because if you look at networking as just talking to somebody else and having a conversation with them, it really <em>is</em> just a conversation, it's not anything scary. We're all people."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Allison</strong>: "Networking works best when it comes from a genuine interest in getting to know people without coming across as expecting anything in return. Fostering genuine and long lasting relationships is extremely important in this industry which goes back to the part about being a good colleague. It's a very small world and you never know who you might work with down the line."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Alia</strong>: "At the end of the day, if you believe your craft is so awesome that people should be paying to listen to it, you shouldn't have any problem whatsoever approaching a producer or a director or a conductor. Just talk to them, they're just people. And if they're not friendly, then, whatever, you can't win them all."
</p>
<h3>*Bonus good news:</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Allison</strong>: "Canada's classical music job market is not all doom and gloom. There are a lot of opportunities out there for professional level work, it's just a matter of being aware of how to access them. Those who are open to change and are willing to put the work into building relationships and using the resources that are available to them will have the best chance at succeeding in the current climate of non-popular music in Canada. "
