## What do you find is special about the Walton *Viola Concerto*? What do you hope to say with the piece?

The Walton Concerto has become one of the most standard repertoires in viola literature. In the baroque, classical, and romantic period, the viola has typically been neglected as a solo instrument, it probably had something to do with the low standard of viola playing. In the 20th century, many fantastic violists started rising, performing as chamber musicians and soloists. Thanks to them, many composers started writing for the viola; Walton's Viola Concerto was one of these works (premiered in 1929). It showcases the viola's dark and warm characters, and allows the performers to showcase their lyrical singing voice and virtuosity using lots of difficult double-stop passages and fast playing. Walton also shows influences of jazz and some eastern music in this work.

One of the many things I love about this work is the fact that it was premiered by Paul Hindemith (1895 - 1963) and that the work played a role in bringing together the duo in friendship.  Hindemith, one of the most influential German composers and educators of the 20th century, is someone I admire very much - actually I recently recorded his Viola Sonata on my Azica Records' disc, *1939*.  Knowing the friendship that blossomed from the collaboration is significant to me somehow.

## When did you join the Toronto Symphony, and what did that mean for you?

I joined the TSO as principal violist when I was 21. I was still in school at the Curtis Institute of Music at the time. I didn't have a lot of orchestral experience previously, and I remember learning a lot of orchestral repertoire for my job at TSO. Getting to know everyone orchestra is a lot of fun, especially when there are so many big personalities!

I also remember commuting between Philadelphia and Toronto for lessons, classes, and concerts. It was amazing to have a job in a leading orchestra and to live in an amazing city, although I was on the road too much to really appreciate the city of Toronto.

## How does an instrumentalist with an orchestral position also set themselves apart as a soloist?

I think it's really like anything else, working hard and finding opportunity.  I have been lucky throughout my career to have the opportunities I've had.  Additionally, the TSO is very proud of their players and offer principal players solo opportunities.

## Can you describe the difference for you between playing in an orchestra or chamber ensemble, versus performing as a soloist in a concerto?

Performing as a soloist is very different than a member of the orchestra.  I find both roles exciting in their own way.  As a soloist, I have more license to share my independent voice and vision for the piece.  As principal violist in the orchestra, I get to support the vision of the conductor by leading my section to perform as one voice.  I feel lucky to have the opportunity to wear different hats in my career, as a soloist, chamber musician and as an orchestral musician.
