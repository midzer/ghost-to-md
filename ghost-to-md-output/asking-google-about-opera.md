title: Asking Google About Opera
---

<p>
	I saw <a href="http://bsomusic.org/stories/what-is-the-internet-asking-google-about-an-orchestra.aspx" target="_blank">this image from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra</a> floating around the Internet, showing us all what the Googling public asks about the different orchestral instruments. I thought it was funny enough, so I compiled some of the broader Google searches related to the opera singers and their voice types.

<p>
	General observations: lots of questions about opera singers and their stereotypical weight, mention of HBO's <em>The Sopranos</em>, and a fair amount of healthy competition between vocal <em>fachs</em>. I hope the mezzos out their find their minimal Google presence as hilarious as I did (no news is good news, ladies!). I also like "why are basses cheaper than guitars".
