## What were your first thoughts when you got the call?

"Where's my score? Where's my \*\*\*\*\*\* score? Oh, it's in my hand." 

I found out that I was going on at 5:30 for a 6pm curtain, so all I knew was that I had to get to the theatre in rush hour. I ordered an Uber, and ran out of the house with just my score and my jacket. I knew that the first role was at the top of the show and that I wouldn't have much time to get ready at the theatre, but luckily I had the best Uber driver, she let me sing full out in her car!

## What was the plan of attack when you arrived at the theatre?

There wasn't time for much but to put on my costume and have a quick chat with the other Norns about all the rope action. The next thing I remember is the curtain opening and then the scene ending, it was a total blur! After that, I had 16 minutes to change into my first Gutrune costume. There were at least four ladies waiting to get me ready, it was a real team effort, to say the least. 

## How much rehearsal time had you had with the roles?

I had a few sessions to walk through the staging, but no matter how many times you run it with a chair playing Brünnhilde and a magazine playing Siegfried, it feels really different on stage. What filled the gaps were the amazingly kind and friendly colleagues I mostly met for the first time onstage. If I wasn't in the right place, I would be gently guided there before I even really knew what happened.

## How did you feel taking your curtain call?

I had the best time. Before my solo scene at the top of act three, I was standing onstage alone, in the dark, while Siegfried's funeral march played and I just started laughing. Wagner is really, really fun and this was a dream cast to sing it with. 

## What advice do you have for understudies who want to be ready for a situation like this?

Treat all show days as though you will be going on. *Götterdämmerung* is a bit of a marathon, to be sure, so I was especially glad I had slept in and taken it easy all day. And, as full-on dorky as it feels, it is always a good idea to go through the staging in your living room on a semi-regular basis. Being called in so last-minute, I had virtually no time to warm up, let alone go over the staging and music, so I just had to trust that I had done enough preparation!
