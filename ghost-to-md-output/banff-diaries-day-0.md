title: "Banff Diaries: Day 0"

It happened; I got on a plane (and then a bus) and landed in Banff. There was the usual mid-flight panic about whether or not my running shoes were *actually* in my suitcase (they were) and *oh god did I forget my phone charger???* 

The flight was, thankfully, unremarkable, but I did get the chance to surprise baritone [Clarence Frazer](/scene/people/clarence-frazer/) (Sam in *Crush*) with a stealth hug at the baggage claim in Calgary. I also met tenor [Pasquale D'Alessio](/scene/people/pasquale-dalessio/) (Otto in *Crush*) while waiting for our airport shuttle; we wasted no time chatting about Mozart, Brahms, 12-tone composing, villains, and Pasquale's band, [Videoman](https://videoman.bandcamp.com/). Finally, I was able to re-visit the Maclab Bistro, Banff's beloved watering hole, with Music Director [Christopher Mokrzewski](/scene/people/christopher-mokrzewski/). Beauty.

As we arrived at the Banff Centre, I had a distinct feeling of having *just been here*. It's been a year since I first worked on *#UncleJohn* with AtG, but it's funny how good experiences never feel that far away. 

Tomorrow, after a mountainous breakfast (puns!), the fun really begins. It's that first-day-of-summer-program anticipation, knowing you're going to meet future friends, and knowing that when it's all over, you'll feel bewildered by how fast the time flew.

That's it for now; the real fun starts with the music.
