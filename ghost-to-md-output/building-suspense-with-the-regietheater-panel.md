title: Building Suspense with The Regietheater Panel
---

<p>
	Yesterday we hosted our very first panel discussion, and I couldn't have been happier with the result. The discussion was smart and frank, with dense conversations about Regietheater, and its role today in opera's evolution. I can't wait to show you the battles of opinions, and the thoughtful questions posed throughout the talk. For now, you'll have to settle on the photo above (taken by our videographer, <a href="http://jeffhiggins.ca/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://jeffhiggins.ca">Jeff Higgins</a>), and a refresher of who joined me for Schmopera's first panel discussion:
