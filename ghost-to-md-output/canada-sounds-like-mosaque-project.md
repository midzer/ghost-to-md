### What was the inspiration behind this Musical Mosaïque?

We dreamed of going on a nation-wide tour for our 10th anniversary, and realised that it was not going to be easy to pull off. So we came up with the idea of commissioning a piece that takes us across the country musically. One thing let to another, and we now have a nation-wide tour, and a great added visual dimension, including listeners from all across Canada.

### What do you hope Canadian audiences will take away from your touring performances?

We hope that audiences will gain a new enthusiasm for a large variety of styles of new music, as well as for the unknown in general. We hope through the act of drawing to music, audiences will be able to digest the unfamiliar music in a more abstract and open-minded fashion. We also hope they will be inspired themselves and find an outlet for their creative minds.  Finally, we hope that they will have fun and enjoy being part of this national project!
