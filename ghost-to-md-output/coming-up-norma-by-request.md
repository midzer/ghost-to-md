title: "Coming up: Norma by request"
---

Next month, [Opera by Request](/scene/companies/opera-by-request/) is bringing some winter warmth in the form of Bellini's *bel canto* stunner, [*Norma*](https://www.facebook.com/events/800602460083386/). Soprano Naomi Eberhard will sing the title role, alongside fellow soprano [Jessica Lane](/scene/people/jessica-lane/) as Adalgisa; and tenor Jason Lamont sings Pollione, the man caught in one of opera's most beautiful love triangles. *Norma* is one night only, **February 6, 7:30pm**,

Opera By Request works the way you'd expect: their seasons are chosen by the artists themselves, often emerging singers who are creating their own opportunities to perform. Their shows are a great chance to hear young artists singing master works in the beautiful College Street United Church, 452 College St., Toronto. Tickets are $20 at the door, or you can reserve in advance by calling (416) 455-2365.

For a taste of Bellini's beauty, have a listen to Maria Callas and Christa Ludwig singing his famous duet for Norma and Adalgisa, "Mira, o Norma".
