title: "Cool concerts: Esprit Orchestra's 2016/17 season"
---

The [Esprit Orchestra](/scene/companies/esprit-orchestra/) has announced its 2016/17 season with a line-up that lives up to their mission of "developing a Canadian musical literature legacy." Four concerts (with catchy titles) present an impressive series of Canadian and world premieres, plus slightly older works by Thomas Adès, John Adams, and George Crumb. Each concert is preceded by a pre-show conversation, moderated by Canadian composer Alexina Louie.

[On **October 23**, *Power On*](http://www.espritorchestra.com/buytickets/concert1.html) celebrates Canadian great R. Murray Schafer, featuring three of his works, plus the Canadian premiere of Andrew Norman's *Switch*, for percussion and orchestra. Under Music Director [Alex Pauk](http://www.espritorchestra.com/aboutus/alexpauk.html), the Esprit Orchestra is joined by mezzo-soprano [Krisztina Szabó](/scene/people/krisztina-szabo/), flautist Robert Aitken, and percussionist Ryan Scott.

[On **November 20**, *m'M*](http://www.espritorchestra.com/buytickets/concert2.html) features Joseph Johnson, principal cellist of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/), on a programme of George Crumb, Philippe Leroux, Zosha Di Castri, and Marc-André Dalbavie. [*Accelerando* on **February 12, 2017**](http://www.espritorchestra.com/buytickets/concert3.html) on February 12, 2017 offers up more newly commissioned Canadian music, by Adam Scime, John Rea, Analia Llugdar and José Evangelista.

The 2016/17 season ends with a "high energy finale," [*Overdrive*, on **April 2, 2017**](http://www.espritorchestra.com/buytickets/concert4.html). Violinist Véronique Mathieu joins the Esprit Orchestra for a programme of Thomas Adès, Chris Paul Harman, and Arthur Honegger, plus treats like John Adams' *Short Ride in a Fast Machine*.
