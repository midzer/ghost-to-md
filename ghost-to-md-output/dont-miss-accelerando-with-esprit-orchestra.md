title: "Don't miss: Accelerando with Esprit Orchestra"
---

True champions of contemporary music in Canada, he [Esprit Orchestra](/scene/companies/esprit-orchestra/) hits the ground running in 2017, with *Accelerando*, their latest collection of new - and brand new - Canadian works.

The concert title derives from the orchestral work of the same name by Montréal composer José Evangelista, commissioned just last year to mark the 50th anniversary of Montréal's subway system.

*Accelerando* features three world premieres, all performed by the Esprit Orchestra under Music Director and conductor Alex Pauk: *Surfacing*, part of a triptych commission by Toronto-based composer [Adam Scime](/scene/people/adam-scime/); *El canto del viento*, from  Argentine-Canadian composer [Analia Lludgar](/scene/people/analia-lludgar/); and BAFTA award-winning [John Rea](/scene/people/john-rea/)'s *Survivance*, co-commissioned by Esprit and the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/people/toronto-symphony-orchestra/) to celebrate the indigenous and Francophone communities across Canada in the country's 150th year.
