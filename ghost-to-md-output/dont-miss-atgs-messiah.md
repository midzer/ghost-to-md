title: "Don't miss: AtG's Messiah"

Readers, if you've been paying attention over the last couple of years, you know that [I'm a big fan](/banff-diaries-a-postlude/) of [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/). They're a good bunch, headed by Artistic Director [Joel Ivany](/scene/people/joel-ivany/) and Music Director [Topher Mokrzewski](/scene/people/christopher-mokrzewski/), and they've been knocking the opera ratings out of the park with productions like [*Death and Desire*](/in-review-death-desire/), [*Pelléas et Mélisande*](/in-review-pelléas-et-mélisande/), and their Mozart/Da Ponte/Ivany trilogy of transladaptations, including *Figaro's Wedding*, [*#UncleJohn*](/unclejohn-the-toronto-story/), and [*A Little Too Cozy*](http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2015/08/04/against-the-grain-writes-operas-next-chapter.html).

Next month, they're reviving [*AtG's Messiah*](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/messiah/), which originally went up in 2013 at Toronto's The Opera House on Queen East. This year, in collaboration with the Corporation of Roy Thomson Hall and Massey Hall, *AtG's Messiah* plays at the Harbourfront Centre Theatre, December 16-19th. Mokrzewski conducts Handel's infamous score (bonus: I can be spotted at the harpsichord), and Ivany collaborates with dancer and choreographer [Jennifer Nichols](https://twitter.com/JennEMethod) to present something innovative, featuring very little parking or barking. "We ditched the 'stand and deliver' performance, tuxedos and choral folders, and mounted a barefoot, choreographed oratorio — one that walked the line between edgy and faithful."

The barefoot, choreographed singers include a 16-voice chorus, and four stellar soloists: soprano [Miriam Khalil](/scene/people/miriam-khalil/), mezzo-soprano [Andrea Ludwig](/scene/people/andrea-ludwig/), tenor [Owen McCausland](/scene/people/owen-mccausland/) and bass-baritone [Stephen Hegedus](/scene/people/stephen-hegedus/). As the AtG team would say, *boom*.

Tickets are on sale, and going quickly. For details and ticket info, follow the box office links below. "This is not your grandma’s *Messiah* (but she would love it, so bring her)."
