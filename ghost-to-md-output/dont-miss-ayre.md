title: "Don't miss: Ayre"
---

On **November 10-12** at Toronto's Ismaili Centre, [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/) presents Osvaldo Golijov's [*Ayre*](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/ayre/). You absolutely do not want to miss it.

*Ayre* is an unreal fusion of Arabic, Hebrew, and Sardinian texts with Sephardic folk melodies, to be performed by soprano [Miriam Khalil](/scene/people/miriam-khalil/) and an eclectic orchestra of 11.

In her close work with Golijov himself, Khalil recalls him saying, "My constant state of exile defines who I am. Even when I was a child in Argentina, I was living in many worlds at the same time."

We first heard Khalil perform *Ayre* at The Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, and it completely shattered any expectations we had of Golijov's music, or of Khalil's range of vocal colour. It feels ancient, reverent, and like the sound of city buskers; it feels like a catchy tune you've heard before, and something intangible.

Khalil's performance is stunning, and to hear her sing Golijov's work adds a new level of admiration for her versatility.

The staging of *Ayre* by AtG Artistic Director [Joel Ivany](/scene/people/joel-ivany/) is preceded by Golijov's *LÃºa Descolorida*, *Yiddishbbuk*, and *Tenebrae*, sung by sopranos [Adanya Dunn](/scene/people/adanya-dunn/) and [Ellen McAteer](/scene/people/ellen-mcateer/). That's three stunning pieces of music, performed by three singers who will absolutely move you.

*Ayre* happens **November 10, 11 and 12 at the Ismaili Centre**, 49 Wynford Dr, Toronto. Doors open at 7:30, and the show begins at 8pm. You *want* to see this. [Click here](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/ayre/) for full details and to purchase tickets.
