title: "Don't miss: Conversations with Isabel Leonard"
---

OPERA America continues its *Conversations* series on April 7th, with an intimate chat with mezzo-soprano [Isabel Leonard](/scene/people/isabel-leonard/). At the National Opera Center, OPERA America President/CEO Marc A. Scorca will sit down with the star singer, fresh from her run as Cherubino in [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/)'s *Le nozze di Figaro*. 

Leonard heads to Santa Fe this summer to sing Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni*, and she'll debut as Charlotte at the Met's *Werther*, in February 2017. That's some exciting versatility. 

[Tickets start at $10](http://www.operaamerica.org/Onstage), and if you can't make it to New York, fear not. The event will be live-streamed starting on **April 7, 7pm ET**, at [www.operaamerica.org/Live](http://www.operaamerica.org/Live).
