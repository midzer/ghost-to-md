The night promises a concert "fit for a king", with modular electronic artist [Acote](https://soundcloud.com/acotesound), and the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra playing music by Purcell and even King Henry VIII. Amanda Smith, Artistic Director of [FAWN Chamber Creative](/scene/companies/fawn-chamber-creative/) directs and designs, with choreography by dancer Mary-Dora Bloch-Hansen.

"Adventure ensues as we experience the world around us for the first time through the eyes of the recently awoken Leeka, a curious and vivacious young woman from a galaxy far away."

The first set of [Haus Musik](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/haus-musik-classical-alternative) starts at tomorrow, **February 2nd** at 8pm with Acote, and Tafelmusk goes on at 9pm.
