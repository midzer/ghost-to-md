This month, the [Oshawa Opera](/scene/companies/oshawa-opera/) kicks off its fall season of 2017/18, with Mascagni's verismo favourite, *Cavalleria rusticana*, for one performance only on **October 29, 3pm**. Mezzo-soprano (and Oshawa Opera Artistic Director) Kristine Dandavino (Santuzza), tenor Jason Lamont (Turridu), mezzo-soprano Anna Belikova (Lucia), baritone Kyle Lehmann (Alfio), and mezzo-soprano Victoria Borg (Lola) join the Oshawa Opera Chorus and [William Shookhoff](/celebrating-10-years-of-opera-by-request/) at the piano.

Their season continues in November with the premiere of Peter Skoggard's *La voix perdue*, featuring soprano Bridget Hogan, Kristine Dandavino (narrator), and pianist Christopher Burton, **November 24, 7:30pm**.

Both performances happen at Kingsview United Church, 505 Adelaide Ave. E, Oshawa.

Tickets can be bought [online via Oshawa Opera's website](https://www.theoshawaopera.com/) or at the door; it's just $25 for adults, and admission is free for people under 18!
