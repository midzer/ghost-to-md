[Second Movement](https://secondmovement.org.uk/), in association with [Tête à Tête](http://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/event/rough-for-opera-15/) are gearing up for the 15th instalment of *rough for opera*, a series of showcases for new opera and works in progress.

*rough for opera #15* features three new operas in development. 

[Jonathan Higgins](/scene/people/jonathan-higgins/)' ***Schutzwall*** is set in 1961 Berlin, one month after the wall was put up, overnight, with no warning. [Catherine Kontz](https://soundcloud.com/catherinekontz)'s ***A Certain Sense of Order*** draws on the life and work of [Anne Sexton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Sexton), the fascinating American poet who struggled with mental illness all her life, and whose shocking poems were considered "confessional". [Benjamin Tassie](/scene/people/benjamin-tassie/)'s ***Hurricane Zoo*** is an operatic adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's *First Visit with Mescalito*, the Gonzo-journalism-style account of his first mescaline trip.

*rough for opera* has presented 41 new and developing operas since 2011, and Tête à Tête is celebrating 20 years of fostering opera in the 20th and 21st centuries. To hear opera in these early stages is a rare opportunity, with a level of intimacy that can't be beat. *rough for opera #15* happens on **March 7, 7:30pm** at The Cockpit Theatre. Tickets are just £6, and you can find out more [right here](http://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/event/rough-for-opera-15/).
