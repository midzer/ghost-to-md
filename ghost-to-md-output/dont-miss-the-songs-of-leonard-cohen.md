For something different this winter, head over to Theatre Passe Muraille to hear Theatre 20's production of [*Chelsea Hotel: The Songs of Leonard Cohen*](http://www.theatre20.com/#!chelsea-hotel/cyyd). Tracey Power directs this "eclectic cabaret" of Cohen's music, which had its premiere in Vancouver in 2012, and has since traveled to Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Calgary, Victoria, Vernon, Banff, and Fort McMurray.

Performers Rachel Aberle, Sean Cronin, Christina Cuglietta, Benjamin Elliot, Jonathan Gould, and Tracey Power pay tribute to Leonard Cohen with special arrangements by music director Steven Charles, played on seventeen different instruments. "Through Cohen’s transcendent songs and lyrical honesty, you will be transported to New York’s infamous hotel – a place full of music and enchantment, desire and passion."

*Chelsea Hotel* runs from February 3 to 21 at Theatre Passe Muraille, 16 Ryerson Avenue, Toronto. For full details and to purchase tickets, follow the box office links below.
