This week, the Toronto Concert Orchestra shines a spotlight on the work of emerging First Nations artists, with [*Voice of a Nation*](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/voice-of-a-nation-tickets-39468035958), a multi-disciplinary concert program combining orchestra, choir, soloists, dance, spoken word, and film.

Led by conductor Kerry Stratton, the concert happens **November 23, 7:30pm** at Grace Toronto Church, 383 Jarvis Street, and features an eclectic programme of music. Ian Cusson's *Different Perspectives*, for youth chorus, tells Canadian stories with a new text by Scarorough youth collective Couronne du Canada; Stravinsky's *L'histoire du soldat* is re-imagined by First Nations choreographer Aria Evans "through a truly Canadian lens"; and mezzo-soprano Rebecca Cuddy sings the new orchestral song cycle by Cusson, *Five Orchestra Songs*, based on MÃ©tis poet Marilyn Dumont's *A Really Good Brown Girl*. The song cycle is directed by Tapestry Opera Artistic Director Michael Mori.

"In 1885 Louis Riel proclaimed, 'My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they awake it will be the artists who give them their spirit back.'"
