Hello, Schmop-Tops!

This coming Sunday, [**November 6th at 3pm**](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html), I think you all should come and join me at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts in downtown Toronto for a lovely concert of some really beautiful music. 

[Toronto Operetta Theatre](/scene/companies/toronto-operetta-theatre/) is presenting [*Waltz Rivals*](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html), featuring the music of Emmerich Kalm치n and Franz Leh치r. These two giants of the genre were contemporaries of composers like Puccini and you can feel the verismo leaking into their scores; however, it's the infusion of folkloric music and themes that makes these works universally appealing. 

Featuring arias, duets, and ensembles from the likes of *The Cs치rd치s Princess*, *The Gypsy Violinist*, *The Circus Princess*, *Countess Maritza*, and of course, *The Merry Widow* (just to name a few), TOT has assembled a fine group of young singers to bring you the best of these tunes. 

With General Director Guillermo Silva-Marin acting as emcee, you'll find "Yours Truly" joined by sopranos [Lucia Cesaroni](/scene/people/lucia-cesaroni/) and Sarah Forestieri and tenors [Michael Barrett](/scene/people/michael-barrett/) and [Adam Fisher](/scene/people/adam-fisher/) waltzing, polkaing, czardas-ing our ways into your hearts. 

It promises to be a lovely Sunday afternoon here in the T-dot, so if you're looking for some beautiful music and beautiful people (myself excluded, #selfdeprecationischarmingright), stop on by. The show is about 75% sold out but there are still some [great seats left](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html), since there isn't a bad seat to be found in the beautifully restored Jane Mallett Theatre. 

Why not [join us on Sunday](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html) for *Waltz Rivals*? Who knows, you'll may find a new favourite tune or you can get the chance to hear some of your favourites.
