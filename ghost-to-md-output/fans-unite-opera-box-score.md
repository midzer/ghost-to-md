title: "Fans unite: Opera Box Score"
---

As devoted as opera fans can be, the passion of a sports fan can be an impressive thing. And, as baffling as it may be for those of us deeply entrenched in band-geekdom, there are indeed opera fans who are *also* sports fans. Weird, right?

So, for those well-balanced fans of opera and sports, there's [*Opera Box Score*](http://www.operaboxscore.com/the-pitch/), the podcast that asks, "what if opera – its performances, personnel and programming – could be demystified, discussed and promoted in such a way as to become as much a part of the public consciousness as sports?"

*Opera Box Score* is hosted by [George Cederquist](http://www.gjcederquist.com/), Chicago-based stage director, and Artistic Director of [Chicago Fringe Opera](/scene/companies/chicago-fringe-opera/); co-hosts include singers Tobias Wright, [Giovanna Jacques](/scene/people/giovanna-jacques/), and [Oliver Camacho](https://twitter.com/theoperacompany) (also the co-host of the OperaNow! Podcast).

You'll hear a little bit of sports talk, and a lot of opera talk, and that familiar (and un-snobby!) format of sports commentary is totally refreshing. 

*Opera Box Score* has just started its second season, and you can have a listen over on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/opera-box-score/id1068542093) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-231280174), and stay in the loop by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/operaboxscore).
