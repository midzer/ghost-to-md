title: "Free live stream: Sondra Radvanovsky at the National Opera Center"
---

On **March 3rd at 7pm EST**, star soprano [Sondra Radvanovsky](/scene/people/sondra-radvanovsky/) joins OPERA America President and CEO Marc A. Scorca for a new instalment of [*Conversations*](http://www.operaamerica.org/content/operacenter/onstage/index.aspx#Conversations), presented by the National Opera Center in New York.

Radvanovsky will chat with Scorca about her "Three Queens" project with [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/) this season (she sings the title roles in Donizetti's *Anna Bolena*, *Roberto Devereux*, and *Maria Stuarda*); plus, she'll talk about her career and success in what will likely be an engaging and honest discussion. 

To catch the event in person at the National Opera Center, 330 Seventh Avenue, **tickets start at $10**, and they're available [online here](http://www.operaamerica.org/content/operacenter/onstage/index.aspx) or by calling (212) 796-8620. If you're not in New York, **the event will also be streamed live, free of charge** [at OPERAAmerica.org](http://www.operaamerica.org/content/OperaCenter/onStage/live.aspx). 

So, mark your calendars for **March 3 at 7pm EST**! In the meantime, you can get caught up with OPERA America's *Conversations* by watching their archives, including maestro [Stephen Lord](https://youtu.be/2LufZ2cfFPA) and [Joyce Di Donato](https://youtu.be/-peZ1aRsZk4).
