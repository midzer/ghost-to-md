title: Friends at the ENO

English National Opera announced their 2015/15 season line-up yesterday, and making an appearance is friend, fellow COC Ensemble graduate, and stellar soprano [Ambur Braid](http://amburbraid.com/). 

She'll sing the Queen of the Night in Simon McBurney's [production of *The Magic Flute*](http://www.eno.org/whats-on/15-16/the-magic-flute), which will run for 13 performances, February 5-March 19, 2016. [Allan Clayton](http://www.allanclayton.com/) sings Tamino, and recent COC visitor [Lucy Crowe](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/soprano/lucy-crowe) (*Hercules*) will sing Pamina.

The production looks spooky, and I'm more than thrilled for Ambur. Brava, friend! [Click here](http://www.eno.org/whats-on/15-16/the-magic-flute#The-Magic-Flute) to find a gallery of production photos from *Flute*'s 2013 run at ENO.
