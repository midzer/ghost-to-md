title: Go hear the Tafelmusik Vocal Competition
---

Next Saturday, you can hear the final round of the inaugural [Tafelmusik Vocal Competition](http://www.tafelmusik.org/education/tafelmusik-vocal-competition), at 1pm in the Trinity-St. Paul's Centre Jeanne Lamon Hall, 427 Bloor St. W. **Admission is free!**

The 9 [finalists](http://www.tafelmusik.org/competition-finalists-biographies) will be heard by jury members [Mary Morrison](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-morrison-emc/), [Catherine Robbin](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catherine-robbin-emc/) (both estemeed voice teachers), Tafelmusik Chief Artistic Advisor [Jeanne Lamon](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/bios/jeanne-lamon), and Tafelmusik Chamber Choir director [Ivars Taurins](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/choir/bios/ivars-taurins). On Saturday afternoon, the singers will compete for 3 prizes, which include $2000 in cash, as well as the opportunity to sing in concert with Tafelmusik. The [competing singers](http://www.tafelmusik.org/competition-finalists-biographies) are:

- Johanna Bronk, mezzo-soprano
- Kim Leeds, mezzo-soprano
- Andrew Rader, countertenor
- Jacques-Olivier Chartier, tenor
- Brian Giebler, tenor
- Zach Finkelstein, tenor
- Jeremy Ludwig, baritone
- David Rugger, baritone
- Jonathan Woody, baritone

The final round calls for three selections by each finalist: an aria from a passion or cantata by J.S. Bach, an aria from a Handel opera or oratorio, and a selection from Jan Dismas Zelenka's *Missa omnium sanctorum* (1741).

I always recommend opera lovers to go and hear voice competitions; it's always fascinating and the energy of the competitors is something that's quite different than seeing them in a production. The event is scheduled from 1-5:45pm, and there are two intermissions during which you can meet the singers and the jury members over some food and drink. Plus, if you stay for the full afternoon, you'll be able to vote for the Audience Choice Winner.

Head over to Trinity-St. Paul's Centre next Saturday afternoon to hear young artists in this inaugural competition. Again, **admission is free!** [Click here](http://www.tafelmusik.org/education/tafelmusik-vocal-competition) for more details.
