title: "Go see this: Tap:Ex Metallurgy"
---

Tapestry opera continues its kick-ass 2015/16 season in November with the latest instalment of *Tap:Ex Metallurgy*. *Tap:Ex* is a performance series started by Artistic Director [Michael Mori](/scene/people/michael-mori/), that is "committed to radically redefining the future of opera." *Metallurgy* blends opera with punk rock, as Canadian punk band [Fucked Up](http://fuckedup.cc/home/) shares the stage with tenor [David Pomeroy](/scene/people/david-pomeroy/) and mezzo-soprano (and chameleon) [Krisztina Szabó](/scene/people/krisztina-szabo/). You'll also catch composer Ivan Barbotin, librettist David James Brock, plus pianist and Tapestry's Resident Conductor [Jordan de Souza](/scene/people/jordan-de-souza/).

Mori puts it simply: "Nothing comes from nothing, and if we don’t allow ourselves the freedom to experiment, collaborate and try new things, opera will remain the same forever." 

Considering the huge departure from opera's norm, and the serious talent making it happen, I'll be bold and say that *Tap:Ex Metallurgy* is a seriously-don't-miss-it event. "All the players in this project are geniuses of their genre," assures Mori.

>It all goes down at the Distillery District's Ernest Balmer Studio, November 19th & 20th at 8pm, and November 21st at 7pm and 10pm. For more info and tickets, follow the box office links below.
