Singers, do you have your summer plans sorted?

Ryerson Theatre School is offering its inaugural [Summer Acting Intensive](http://ryerson.ca/theatreschool/summer/summer-acting-intensive/index.html#) from **August 8-13, 2016**, directed by Ryerson faculty Kelly Arnsby. The week-long programme includes classes in scene study, movement, and voice, and culminates in a "work in progress" presentation on the final day.

"The course is open to anyone aged 19 years and up:  professional actors; those considering a career in acting; educators; artists from other disciplines; or anyone who would like to experience a week of theatre school training in acting!"

Singers, you're all pros at making the most out of your summer education, and summer programs rooted in operatic and vocal training are a big part of that. At $450 (plus HST), the [Summer Acting Intensive](http://ryerson.ca/theatreschool/summer/summer-acting-intensive/index.html#) is an economical, focused approach to honing skills that are vital for any working opera singer. As opera companies continue the move towards producing chamber-sized operas in intimate venues, acting chops have become a necessity, rather than a bonus feature on top of a killer voice.
