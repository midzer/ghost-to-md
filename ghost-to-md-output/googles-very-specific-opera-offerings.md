title: Google's very specific opera offerings
---

A couple of quick finds for the online opera fans, who consistently bemoan the state of opera on the Internet. If you use [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/), you'll be pleased to notice that there's a radio station that plays Metropolitan Opera broadcasts from their 2011-12 season. Sort of oddly specific, I know, but lots of good stuff on there.

New(ish) on [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/home/en-ca/) is a station simply called "Opera," which is less actual opera and more opera singers and their various albums. If you can ignore the periodic Tosti songs and Debussy's *Chansons de Bilitis* mixed in with your Kaufmann arias, it's not a bad time.

Where do you all go for your online opera fix? Leave your tips in the comments below!
