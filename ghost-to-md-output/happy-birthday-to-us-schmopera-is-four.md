title: "Happy birthday to us: Schmopera is four!"
---

Can you believe Schmopera is celebrating its fourth birthday?

That's four years of [conversations with opera singers](/what-weve-learned-by-talking-with-108-opera-singers/), [tips and tricks](/categories/how-to/) of the trade, [hot topics](/categories/op-ed/), and of course, [going to the opera](/categories/reviews/).

We're proud to call ourselves an artist-run publication, set on demystifying opera without dumbing it down. In this past year, we've expanded our opera coverage to cities across North America and Europe - our new [contributors](/authors/) are an amazing, dedicated group of loquacious artists who keep our mission afloat.

So readers, thank you for four amazing years! We love the passionate feedback we get from you - proof that opera is alive, kicking, and surrounded by a feisty fan base.

Cheers, and thanks for the high notes! Now, where's our cake?
