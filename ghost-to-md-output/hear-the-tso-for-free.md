As a thank-you to its loyal audience, the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/) and Music Director Peter Oundjian are presenting a *free concert* at Roy Thomson Hall, July 7th at 12:30pm. The concert is a generous closing to a packed 2014/15 season at the TSO, which included Lang Lang's at the 2nd annual Chinese New Year Celebration, Emanuel Ax curating the RBC Piano Extravaganza, and the North American premi√®re of George Benjamin's opera, *Written on Skin*, starring the incomparable [Barbara Hannigan](/scene/people/barbara-hannigan/).

What's on the free program? Selections from Holst's *The Planets*, Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Stravinsky's *Firebird Suite* and more. 

Seating is by general admission, on a first-come, first-served basis. [Click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/Thank-You-Toronto.aspx) for details and the full concert program.
