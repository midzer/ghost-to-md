The [Associated Studios](http://www.associatedstudios.co.uk/about/), one of Britain's leading academies for the study of opera, music theatre, and acting, is soon auditioning for both its upcoming 8-week and 4-month [Opera Courses](http://www.associatedstudios.co.uk/courses/opera-courses/).

The [8-week course](http://www.associatedstudios.co.uk/event/8-week-opera-course-focusing-on-french-and-english-opera/) has a focus on French and English opera, and classes include Pilates, acting, French language, solo repertoire, ensemble repertoire, and performance classes with répétiteurs and directors. The course runs November 24-February 3; the audition application deadline is this week, but Associate Studios keeps waitlist, and there may be flexibility if you're quick.

The next [4-month course](http://www.associatedstudios.co.uk/event/opera-course-london-2-2/) runs twice weekly, from February 23-July 7, 2017, and singers should apply for an audition before the end of December. The course includes language coaching, private sessions with coaches and conductors, movement/Pilates classes, and sessions in professional etiquette, stagecraft, and audition technique.
