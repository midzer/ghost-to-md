title: I just met a girl named Cecilia

I don't know how I feel about the [recent announcement](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/cecilia-bartoli-to-sing-maria-in-west-side-story/?_r=0) that Italian mezzo Cecilia Bartoli will star as Maria in Leonard Bernstein's *West Side Story* at the 2016 Salzburg Whitsun Festival; Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. She'll probably be cute as all get-out, but I'm just having a hard time picturing it. Maybe this is how people felt when Ben Heppner announced he'd be joining the cast of Mirvish's *Titanic The Musical*.

What do you guys think? Will Ceci be a charming Maria? I'll admit I'm totally curious to hear an Italian Baroque specialist play a Puerto Rican immigrant in English, in Salzburg. The cultures, they're colliding, guys.
