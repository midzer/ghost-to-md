title: I kind of like Black Pearls...
---

One afternoon a few years back, after [discovering these on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1blyLl4tiQ&list=RDT1blyLl4tiQ#t=531), I showed them to a singer friend of mine; I figured they'd find the collection of operatic misses as fascinating as I did. My singer friend didn't find it fascinating, perhaps due to the sympathy he couldn't help but feel for the voices. Perhaps singers will find me somewhat odd for this, but I think Perle Nere, the three-part collection of onstage misses by opera singers, was one of the first ways I became excited about the capabilities and limitations of the human voice. The collection pieces together moments like the _Rigoletto_ quartet with the tenor singing a semitone flat, crazy tenor cracks in _Aida_, missed high notes in _Flute_, onstage drunkenness, etc. It's [AfroPoli](https://www.youtube.com/user/AfroPoli/featured)'s YouTube channel, and his commentary gives context to the clips, as snarky as it sometimes may be. So, a disclaimer for the readers who sing: this may gain a reaction similar to when a guy watches another guy get hit below the belt. But I think it's neat to hear vocal "mishaps", because you can start to hear how the thing should be put together. Anyway, enjoy?
