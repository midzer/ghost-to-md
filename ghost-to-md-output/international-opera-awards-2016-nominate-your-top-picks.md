title: "International Opera Awards 2016: nominate your top picks!"
---

It's one thing to make a list of our [favourite operas of 2016](/roundup2016-greg-jennas-top-10/), but it's another to put those favourites up for well-deserved awards.

The 2016 [International Opera Awards](http://www.operaawards.org/about/) is accepting [nominations until **January 8, 2017**](
http://www.operaawards.org/nominate/), for your top picks of the year. The categories range from individual artists, to productions, to world premieres, to non-singing operatic newcomers. 

The International Opera Awards raises funds for almost 50 bursaries for aspiring artists. It's super easy to submit your nominations, and it's a great chance to push lesser-known gems into the spotlight. 

[Click here](http://www.operaawards.org/nominate/) to vouch for the performances and artists you think are worthy of an award, and hopefully of a financial boost.
