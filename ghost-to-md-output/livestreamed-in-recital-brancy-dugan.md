Tonight at 7pm ET, you can catch celebrated song duo [John Brancy](/scene/people/john-brancy/) and [Peter Dugan](/scene/people/peter-dugan/) in recital at the U.S. Naval Academy.

They'll be performing their recital programme entitled *A Silent Night: A Memorial in Song*, a fitting introduction to their album, *The Journey Home*, which is [available now for pre-order](https://www.johnbrancy.com/pre-order/).

*The Journey Home* is inspired by the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI, and features traditional picks (Schubert, Vaughan Williams), as well as popular and art songs by composers who were killed in the war.
