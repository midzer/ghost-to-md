title: "Lohengrin Redux: an opera fanfic contest"
---

Fanfiction writers, listen up. The Wagner Society of Santa Fe his holding a contest called "Lohengrin Redux," where you can submit your own original epilogue to the story of Wagner's *Lohengrin*.

"Summon your muse and tell us what happens to Lohengrin after he gets on the swan-less boat at the end of the opera.  Did his boat turn into a time machine and bring him to America's shores to clean up in the aftermath of our presidential election?  Perhaps Lohengrin jumps ship entirely and decides he'd rather dance to Tchaikovsky ballet music."

The judges are Wagnerian soprano Jeanne-Mich√®le Charbonnet, opera critic George Loomis, and Aidan Lang, Artistic Director of Seattle Opera; together, they'll choose a winning entry, which will be publicly performed at a Santa Fe venue still yet-to-be-chosen. 

Submissions must be no longer than 150 words, and can be in prose or in verse - set to the music of "In fernem Land". All entries must be original, and "suitable for a general audience," which we interpret as "not too adult."

Before the deadline on **January 31, 2017**, email your submissions to [wagnersocietyofsantafe@gmail.com.](mailto:wagnersocietyofsantafe@gmail.com) For more details, [click here.](http://operaamerica.org/applications/NOW/index.aspx?id=898#details)
