title: Look at all the new operas!
---

I came across this [comprehensive list](http://vagnethierry.fr/contemporary-operas.html) of operas written after World War II, compiled by French writer and critic [Thierry Vagne](http://vagnethierry.fr/about/). There are hundreds of operas listed by John Adams, Krzysztof Penderecki, Steve Reich, Harrison Birtwistle, Benjamin Britten, and way, *way* more that I'd bet you've never heard of.

A teacher of mine, who is a big champion of new music, once reminded me that producing new opera in great *quantity* eventually begets *quality*. At the time of Mozart or Verdi, there were also hundreds of so-so composers writing, perhaps, forgettable operas. I wonder what a similar list of operas written post-French Revolution, or post-American Civil War would look like. Mozart, Rossini, and Wagner would have their work on those lists, along with hundreds of other operas that never got a second play (by these same composers, probably).

Out of interest, I suggest perusing Vagne's [list](http://vagnethierry.fr/contemporary-operas.html). Some great titles in there, like Penderecki's *Die schwarze Maske*, and Kris Defoort's *The Woman Who Walked Into Doors*. It's a good thing to remind ourselves that living in the middle of artistic history is much different than looking back on the winners.
