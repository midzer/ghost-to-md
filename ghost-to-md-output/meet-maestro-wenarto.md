title: Meet Maestro Wenarto
---

I just want to make sure everyone knows about [Maestro Wenarto](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenarto). He's in Seattle, and he loves to sing on camera; he has a channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenarto) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/wenarto), and you should go spend some time over there immediately. He's made over 1800 music videos, plenty of them operatic. I wouldn't say he's got a beautiful voice, but he's got determined pipes, and I can't argue with the _Ã©lan_. Example:

And his German isn't too bad:

And he got a bunch of people to be the Moorish Slaves from _Aida_:

Silliness, Maestro Wenarto. I like it. I kind of want to see him as Dr. Blind in _Die Fledermaus_.
