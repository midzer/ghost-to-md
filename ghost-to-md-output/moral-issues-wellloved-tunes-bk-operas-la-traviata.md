title: "Moral issues & well-loved tunes: BK Opera's La traviata"
---

## What elements of "immorality" that surrounded La traviata when it was first written do you think still hold weight today?

The largest one is the demonisation of sex workers. In its day, the character of Violetta was portrayed in quite a sympathetic light - the audience of the time was not overly happy with this. I think today, however, while we have moved on somewhat, sex workers are still demonised. We sometimes forget about moral issues that still carry weight in opera by assuming they are not relevant to us anymore, but I think the demonisation of sex workers in the greatest issue surrounding this piece.

## What are the unique challenges of rehearsing and presenting such a staple piece as *La traviata*?

The challenges of rehearsing staple repertoire mainly lie in peoples' preconceived notions of the piece. They come to rehearsal subconsciously thinking they know the whole thing when they don't. For example, everyone has heard or probably sung the "Brindisi", but knowing that there is a rest in the middle of the word "questo" might slip one's mind. 

Fine details are hard to rehearse in any opera, but they are a particularly hard challenge in staple repertoire. "The devil is in the details," as they say, but with a piece like this, it is hard to come at it with a blank slate. With less performed pieces, it is sometimes easier to develop your own interpretation - with so many performances out there it is almost inevitable to have someone else's version at least slightly in your ear.

## What are some common misconceptions that opera lovers may have about *La traviata* or its characters?

I think the idea that Violetta is a delicate, fragile person who sacrifices herself for a man is a problematic one. She makes the decision to leave Alfredo with a heavy heart and is independent and strong - which then makes her death all the more heart-wrenching.

## Do you have any favourite moments in the score/libretto?

"Aaaaamami Alfreeeeeeedo!" Hands down.
