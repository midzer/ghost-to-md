We've got exciting news! [MusicalToronto.org](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/10/01/introducing-a-new-expanded-musical-toronto/) has expanded into a whole new site, and you should [get over there to check it out](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/10/01/introducing-a-new-expanded-musical-toronto/). It's got a new look, a [great new way](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/datebook/) to keep track of upcoming concerts and events, and it'll soon include an interactive map of Toronto concert venues.

Here's the best part: the team of MusicalToronto.org writers, led by [Michael Vincent](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/mt-staff-and-writers/), has expanded as well, and it [includes yours truly](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/mt-staff-and-writers/). That's right: Schmopera will be contributing bi-weekly content about everything opera. So, on top of our usual supply of opera news, opinions and tangents, you can watch for our exclusive contributions to MusicalToronto.org. If you miss a post, don't worry; they'll be archived at Schmopera.com.

The first post [just came out](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/10/01/schmopera-opera-the-inside-job/), and I think it's going to be the beginning of something cool.
