This Sunday, **September 10** is World Suicide Prevention Day, and for the second year in a row [Mysterious Barricades](http://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/concerts/) is presenting its extraordinary musical event, [*A Cross-Canada Concert for Suicide Awareness, Prevention and Hope*](http://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/concerts/). 

With a mission "to raise awareness surrounding the mysterious barricades between mental illness and health, between the darkness of depression and a flicker of hope, between life and death," Mysterious Barricades brings **free concerts** to 15 Canadian cities, starting in St. John's, NL, and ending in Victoria, BC. The organization is led by mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Turnbull, whose late husband died by suicide two years ago.
