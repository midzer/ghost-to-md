---

[Esprit Orchestra](/scene/companies/esprit-orchestra/), a Canadian leader in new orchestra music, launches its new season this week with the first of five concerts, all packed with new and brand new works.

On **October 24, 8pm**, Esprit's cosmos-themed season opener is titled [*For Orbiting Spheres*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/for-orbiting-spheres/), named after the first piece on the programme by American composer Missy Mazzoli (*Proving Up*, *Breaking the Waves*). Mazzoli's work gets its Canadian premiere along with Unsuk Chin's *Chorós Chordón*, and Tristan Keuris' *Sinfonia*.

**November 28, 8pm** is [*North/White*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/north-white/), a programme that includes work by Canadian favourite Alexina Louie, Icelandic composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir's *Dreaming*. The concert gets its name from the work by R. Murray Schafer, who in a depiction of the dichotomy between Arctic beauty and environmental destruction, places a snowmobile in the percussion section. Yes, a snowmobile. "I decided to place a snowmobile in the percussion section as a symbol of noise and pollution generated by technology," Schafer clarifies.

Esprit's 2018/19 season closes on **March 24, 8pm**, with [*Grand Slam!*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/grand-slam/) Joseph Johnson, principal cellist of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, plays Unsuk Chin's *Cello Concerto*, and Esprit's principal percussionist Ryan Scott performs Maki Ishii's *Afro Concerto*.
