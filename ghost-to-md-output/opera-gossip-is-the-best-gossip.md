title: Opera Gossip is the best Gossip

I heard some interesting news through that long and winding operatic grapevine: Toronto's small and mighty opera companies are banding together! There are some great creative minds behind this indie opera collective, and the possibilities are even greater. By forming a collective, the companies will be able to share resources like performance venues, audition space, and their respective contact lists of singers. The result could be cool: a combined, _full_ season of diverse productions from our favourite little opera companies.

So for now, I give you only educated gossip. And for now, you should all get to know these companies ASAP, so that you can, in true indie fashion, say "I knew them when...." Here are a few links to check out:
