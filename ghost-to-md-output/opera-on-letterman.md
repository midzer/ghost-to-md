title: Opera on Letterman
---

In case you haven't heard, David Letterman is [retiring](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-letterman-retiring-in-2015-20140403) from his late-night hosting duties on May 20th. That's tonight! So, I went to work finding some opera on the *Late Show*, as my small but mighty nod to Letterman and his 33-year career (22 years on CBS, 11 on NBC).

First up: Ren√©e Fleming sings Letterman's Top 10.

On a more serious note, Letterman had Jessye Norman on last year. The interview is below, and you can [click here to watch her sing "Midnight Special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7rkTYFN6h8&spfreload=1) How fun would it have been for her to bust out some Wagner? Maybe a few years earlier...

That's sort of it for opera and Letterman, unless you count [this impersonal (and poorly excerpted) promo spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeTUKffXtjc) for the Metropolitan Opera's 2007 *Il barbiere di Siviglia*.

I can't really argue with the three-decade career in show business, though. Letterman isn't my favourite late-night host, but I think there's something to be said for longevity. Maybe some more of this "fine arts" stuff will make it on to *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, set to succeed Letterman post-retirement. [Colbert likes opera](http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/the-colbert-report-season-4-episode-61-nathan-gunn-365962), after all.

We'll miss you, David!
