title: Pocket Concerts and their worthy campaign
---

Toronto's [Pocket Concerts](http://www.pocketconcerts.ca/) has launched a new [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketconcerts/pocket-concerts-season-3-chamber-music-in-toronto) for the next 30 days, and it's a cause that I think is important to share.

"Since starting Pocket Concerts in 2013, we have been teaming up with our hosts to provide the ultimate chamber music experience: listening to fantastic music played by some of Canada's best chamber musicians, all in the intimate and comfortable environment of our hosts' living rooms."

Pocket Concerts is entering their third season, and they're looking to the public to help lower ticket prices, support their artists, and promote these very cool concerts. Music lovers, listen up: "We offer a complete chamber music experience: listening and learning among friends, with a glass of wine or beer in hand. We are bringing chamber music back home!"

You can find more details by [visting their Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketconcerts/pocket-concerts-season-3-chamber-music-in-toronto), or in the video below, created by friend of Schmopera, [Jeff Higgins](http://jeffhiggins.ca):
