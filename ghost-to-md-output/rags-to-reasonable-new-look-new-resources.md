Are you an artist who's stressed out about the prospect of managing your money? (A rare concept, no doubt...)

In case you're not already following him on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ragstoreasonable/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rags2reasonable), we'd love to introduce you to Christopher Enns, Canadian tenor and the founder of [Rags to Reasonable](http://www.ragstoreasonable.com/). R2R offers financial advice catered to artists and their unpredictable incomes, and Chris is a certified financial planner and coach who can help you get money-smart without making you feel money-stupid.

We're big fans of Rags to Reasonable, and Chris is a [contributing author](/authors/christopher-enns/) to Schmopera.com. Have a look at R2R's [revamped website](http://www.ragstoreasonable.com/), full of tools and resources to help even the most budget-challenged of us get on a sensible financial track.

Get to know Chris in the video below, and read his words of fiscal wisdom.
