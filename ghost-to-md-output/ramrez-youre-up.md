title: Ramírez, you're up.

Tomorrow night, Toronto-based tenor [Ernesto Ramírez](http://www.edgarernestoramirez.com/) will step into the title role of Donizetti's _Roberto Devereux_, playing now at the [Four Seasons Centre](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/RobertoDevereux.aspx). Italian tenor [Giuseppe Filianoti](http://giuseppefilianoti.com/) was scheduled to sing the run, but he withdrew from the first few performances, and the Canadian Opera Company brought in American tenor Leonardo Capalbo to step in. Filianoti was supposed to return for the last half of the run of _Devereux_, but he recently announced he won't be returning to Toronto.

So, you can catch Mexican tenor Ernesto Ramírez, singing opposite [Sondra Radvanovsky](http://www.sondraradvanovsky.com/), onstage tomorrow at 4:30pm at the Four Seasons Centre. The final three performances of _Devereux_ will be sung by Spanish tenor [José Bros](http://www.josebros.com/Josebros/A_Biografia.html). For tickets and more info, click [here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/RobertoDevereux.aspx).
