title: "Rhoda and the Fossil Hunt: where opera meets science"

## What do you find uniquely enjoyable about performing for young audiences?

Kids are much more open about opera. They have very few preconceptions. When the audience is just children, they tend to be much more enthusiastic than adult audiences. For *Rhoda and the Fossil Hunt*, children will be there with their parents, and children behave differently when with their parents. So we'll see.

## How have you considered the performance space in the American Museum of Natural History and the subject matter - arguably unique among operas - in performing *Rhoda and the Fossil Hunt*?

I presume the acoustics of the museum space will be very lively with a lot of reverb. Performing under and around dinosaur skeletons as we sing about them will be exciting and unique to say the least. That will be our "set". We will be performing on the floor where the audience is standing, and we will be singing among the audience, not on a stage above them. Singer and listener will be face to face.

## What do you think are the strong connections between science and the arts/creativity?

The very physical act of singing involves the science of vocal production and the imagination involved in making the appropriate sounds. Then there's the science of sound in the creation of musical instruments, and the science of acoustics in performance halls and recording studios. Composers have included scientific subjects and references, from Mozart's send-up of the real Dr. Mesmer in *CosÃ¬ fan tutte*, to John Adams' *Dr. Atomic* about Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. The very act of scientific discovery is a creative one.
