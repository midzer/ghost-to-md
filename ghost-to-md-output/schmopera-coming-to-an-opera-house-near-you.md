title: "Schmopera: coming to an opera house near you!"
---

Readers, we've got an exciting announcement to make!

Starting this fall, Schmopera welcomes a savvy, enthusastic bunch of new writers across North America and Europe. They're poised and ready to head to the opera, and bring you review coverage from more of the world's stages. 

We've got contributors in **Chicago**, **New York**, **Philadelphia**, **Atlanta**, **Los Angeles**, **Miami**, **Edmonton**, **London**, **Frankfurt**, and more. That means we can broaden our coverage of the 2017/18 season and catch more artists at work. With the help of our new writers, we'll be able to better represent the cool and complementary web of opera happenings across the world. 

We're super proud about this next step, and it's happening in part as a result of our recently-launched [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/schmopera). If you like what you're reading here at Schmopera, and you want to see us continue to broaden our reach, consider visiting our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/schmopera) and becoming a supporter. It's way better than wading through an ad-littered website, and there are perks for patrons!

So readers, get excited for fall: we may be coming to an opera house near you!
