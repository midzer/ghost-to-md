title: Schmopera goes west

Exciting news! In July, I'll be heading to work at [Open Space](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1457), the exciting new program  partnering [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) with [The Banff Centre](http://www.banffcentre.ca/media-release/1156/banff-centre-partners-with-against-grain-theatre-and-canadian-opera-company/) and the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/). There, we'll explore [_Uncle John_](https://twitter.com/RakePunished), the brand new adaptation of Mozart's _Don Giovanni _with a libretto by AtG Theatre's Artistic Director, [Joel Ivany](https://twitter.com/joelivany).

The best part is this: Schmopera will be able to bring you behind-the-scenes coverage of all the #UncleJohn goings-on. Before we even begin, we'll introduce you to the cast and creative team, and get you up to speed on Against the Grain Theatre, _Don Giovanni_, and opera's history at The Banff Centre. Once we get rolling, we'll plant cameras in rehearsals, and show you our favourite photos, tweets, and grizzly bear sightings of the day.

Oh, and the camera _will be rolling_ when we take [Topher](http://www.christophermokrzewski.com/Home/Christopher_Mokrzewski.html) on a nature walk.

Sounds fun, right? Stay tuned, because it'll kick off soon!

And a grizzly-bear count, because it's Banff.
