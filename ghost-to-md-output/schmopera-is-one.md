title: Schmopera is One!

<p style="text-align: left;">
	Cheers, readers! There's yet another reason to celebrate during this festive season: Schmopera is one year old!
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	Thanks are due to our readers for a fantastic first year of hot opera topics, chats that got us thinking, and for all the great work by Canadian opera companies, large and small.  Even bigger thanks go to my guest contributors, Gregory Finney and Isaiah Bell. Greg, Isaiah, thanks for keeping the comment section interesting. I'm celebrating Schmopera's first birthday by collecting 10 of my favourite posts of the year, so you can read what you missed, and re-read what you loved.

	Year one: success! Thanks again, readers!
