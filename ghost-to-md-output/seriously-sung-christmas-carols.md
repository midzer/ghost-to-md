title: Seriously sung Christmas carols
---

Christmas is a great time for mashing unlikely singers together onto one stage so they can all sing some carols together. Like in 2000, when Plácido Domingo did a holiday concert with Vanessa Williams, Tony Bennett, and Charlotte Church. Here's Plácido and Tony giving us a good old "The First Noël":

This next one has got to be my favourite. In an homage to both Christmastime collaborations, and sort of to David Bowie's [infamous duet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiXjbI3kRus) with Bing Crosby in 1977, Bryn Terfel takes his turn to duet with the late voice of Bing to sing "White Christmas". It's bizarre and amazing; I love how Bryn takes a breath between "Christ-" and "-mases" as the end.

In 2006, Renée Fleming joined the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for their Christmas concert, to sing "I'll Be Home for Christmas". The singing is [extra scoopy](/hot-topics-singers-who-scoop/) and the set is big-scale-holiday-concert-fabulous. #toomanypoinsettias.

I suppose it's not Christmas without the Three Tenors, right? Here's their "Silent Night", in as many languages as they could fit in, and a curious order of designating solo verses that has me curious about their management.

For some classy Christmas carolling, one can always count on Leontyne Price. Have a listen to her stunning singing of "O Holy Night". You'll want to hang in for the big high note, I promise you.

Finally, this gem. In 1957, Frank Sinatra directed *Happy Holidays with Bing & Frank*, starring himself and Bing Crosby. If you've not seen it, it starts out with a warm Christmas visit, and it's just worth the watch.
