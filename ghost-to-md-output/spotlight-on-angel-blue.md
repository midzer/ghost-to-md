## Why do you sing, and why are you doing it professionally?

I just like music, I love sound. The best way for me to be a part of music making is to sing. I sing because of my Dad. He introduced me to classical music when I was about 4 years old, and I've been hooked on it since. I sing professionally because I love it and it is one of the jobs that makes me the most happy. It's a blessing to be able to sing professionally. I love it!

I'm also a presenter for the BBC Proms and BBC Cardiff Singer of the World. Singing has opened many doors for me, and I'm grateful for that.

## What does "good singing" mean to you? What does it feel like when you achieve it?

Good singing... I'm not sure that it can really be described. I don't know what good singing is, really; I only know that when I feel good in my body, then I'm usually singing well. For me, "good singing" is so much more than technique. It's easy to focus on breath, diction, phrasing, or placement, but I think for me what constitutes good singing is when I'm completely emotionally involved/connected with my character. When my character/performance takes me to another level of singing and I get lost in the music itself, then I feel that is "good singing" or a "good performance". 

I suppose, for me, that good singing simply means that I'm committed to whatever I'm singing, be it opera, oratorio, or a gospel song I grew up with.

## What do young singers need to do more of? What should they do less of?

Be yourself and be happy being yourself. Oftentimes so many young singers in the opera world feel that they need to "fit in" with whatever is popular in the field. In slang terms we say, "do you!" Just be yourself and be happy being yourself, singing like yourself, looking like yourself, be comfortable with your voice...its strengths and its weaknesses. Even the weaknesses (if you choose to call them that) make you unique.

Singers should try to be more positive with themselves. Encourage yourself, be confident, keep practicing, and please save yourself the trouble of wasting time by comparing yourself to others. I’ll be the first to tell you...it doesn’t help, and in fact, it just takes up time that you could be spending on learning music or with your family. Just my opinion.

## Do you have any "bucket list" roles you'd like to sing (realistically or otherwise)?

In my heart I am one of the world’s greatest Sieglindes, or even Brünnhildes. I could listen to *Die Walküre* all day, everyday. Realistically though... I’d like to sing Tosca and Leonora in *Il Trovatore*.

## How do you explain your job to non-music folks?

I compare my job to that of an athlete. Being an opera singer is like being in the NBA or NFL... I have some performances/games at home, but most of them are away and for long periods of time. If I get injured, then I can be out for the rest of the show/game or if it's really bad, for the remainder of the season.
