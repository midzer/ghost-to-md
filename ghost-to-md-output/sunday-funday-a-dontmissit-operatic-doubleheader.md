title: "Sunday Funday: a don't-miss-it operatic double-header"
---

On **Sunday, January 21**, Torontonians are in for a double-header of creative opera events.

From **2-6pm at The Smiling Buddha** (961 College St.), stop by [FAWN Chamber Creative](/scene/companies/fawn-chamber-creative/)'s 2018 season launch party. The event underscores FAWN's upcoming, interdisciplinary projects - particularly their Convergence Series, which explores art music with artists from outside classical circles.

You'll catch two live performances, the first by electronic music composer [Castle If](http://www.castleif.com/press.html), whose "retro-futuristic cosmic exotica" sound is inspired by the pioneers of synth and electronica. Next up is a taste of FAWN's newest music-theatre project, featuring a collaboration between modular synth artist [Acote](https://soundcloud.com/acotesound), dancer Mary-Dora Bloch-Hansen, and [FAWN team members](http://www.fawnchambercreative.com/fawnteam/).

"One of the things I love most about music is the undeniable connections between different genres," says Amanda Smith, FAWN Founding Artistic Director & Resident Stage Director. "I’ve always listened to electronic music with a similar ear as I do with classical and my experience as a listener is often comparable – so many intricate musical layers and visuals to explore."

The event is 19+, and admission is pay-by-donation, the proceeds going toward support of FAWN and its artists. More details are available via their [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/203711103539051/).

For the after-party, head over to Bad Dog Comedy Theatre (875A Bloor St. W) for [*Whose Opera Is It Anyway?*](https://www.facebook.com/events/380818205663330/) The game-based opera improv show presented by [Loose Tea Music Theatre](/scene/companies/loose-tea-music-theatre/) is now a regular event, happening on the **third Sunday of each month at 9:30pm**.

In this awesome night out, professional opera singers (and one pianist) mash together their musical skills with comedy and improv - they'll sing about anything you can throw at them (anything!). Plus, the show is hosted by Schmopera's own [Greg Finney](/authors/greg/).

"It is electric and hilarious watching something like this unfold in front of your eyes," says Loose Tea Founder & Artistic Director Alaina Viau.

Tickets are just $12, available [online](http://baddogtheatre.com/calendar/).
