title: "Talking with composers: Ivan Barbotin"

## How would you describe your musical aesthetic? How have you heard it described by others?

I've heard myself described as a melodist. I do think that a naturally flowing tune should be at the heart of any compelling composition, especially when it comes to vocal music.

## How do you write music when you're not feeling particularly inspired (yet)?

I don't really believe in inspiration. If what you are referring to by that word is a state of mind allowing for a free and easy flow of ideas, then I think it can be activated by simply sitting down and doing the work at hand. If at first nothing interesting comes to mind, I think the process itself eventually activates the neural circuitry required for being "in the zone".

## How do you think the perception of being a working composer compares to the reality of the job?

I've had all kinds of reactions when introducing myself as a composer, from respect to curiosity to derision to boredom. In reality, it's just a very fun full-time job.

## Do you have a song/album/artist that youâ€™d consider a guilty pleasure?

I like over-the-top, anthemic EDM. ATB and Kaskade would be good examples. 

## Out of your body of work, what are you most proud of, to date?

The most fun project so far was probably scoring for *Cosmic Vistas*, an astronomy TV series. I'm passionate about the subject and working on the series was a pure joy.

I'm currently working on a series of pop songs for a computer game. I started out in pop music and I'm really enjoying the chance to revisit the genre.
