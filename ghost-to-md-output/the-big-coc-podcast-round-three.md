title: The Big COC Podcast, round three
---

Well, Schmopera is officially a [veteran](/schmopera-makes-it-to-the-big-leagues/) of the [Big COC Podcast](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/Podcasts.aspx). Later this week, mark my third appearance on the COC's official podcast, joining guests _Opera Canada_ editor Wayne Gooding and arts journalist [Catherine Kustanczy](https://twitter.com/catekustanczy) ([_Hyperalleric_](https://twitter.com/hyperallergic), [_Torontoist_](https://twitter.com/Torontoist)). Host extraordinaire [Gianmarco Segato](https://twitter.com/ducadiposa) will lead a chat about the latest current events in the opera world. What will the topics be? A little Met, a little elitism; but you'll have to listen to really find out. In the meantime, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/Podcasts.aspx) for archives of past episodes of the Big COC Podcast.
