title: The Dallas Opera picks its Women Conductors
---

The Dallas Opera has created a new residential program, the [Institute for Women Conductors](http://dallasopera.org/learn/womens-conducting-institute/). "This program has already generated tremendous international interest, and over extremely 100 talented women applied -- from the U.S. and 26 other countries. The field was extremely competitive, and the acceptance on the program is recognition of the significant accomplishments in the candidateâ€™s career to date."

The Dallas Opera has announced the participants for the program, which include 6 young conductors and four observers:

- [Jennifer Condon](/scene/people/jennifer-condon/)
