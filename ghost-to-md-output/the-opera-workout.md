Stay happy and motivated with a short thought of booze (the reward system works well, I find):

Now we get into some stamina training; if Beverly can do this, you can turn up your incline a bit.

By this time, I could usually use a fresh burst of inspiration. Here are some Valkyries to help you out. You have a new mantra, and it is "_Ho-jo-to-ho!!_"

We're getting to the home stretch; time for some unforgiving, unrelenting shrieking to spur you on.

And now let's race to the finish (joyfully, of course) and bring 'er home with some more Rossini, the guy who's always guaranteed to raise your heart rate.
