title: When Disney made a cartoon about an opera-singing whale
---

So, in 1946 Walt Disney produced an anthology of animated short films, called _[Make Mine Music](http://movies.disney.com/make-mine-music)_. There are ten film segments, almost all of them set to music; there's an animation of Prokofiev's _Peter and the Wolf_, and the artists involved include [Benny Goodman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman) and the [Andrews Sisters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andrews_Sisters). But _Make Mine Music_ caught my attention because of the last film segment, called _The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met_. It's about a whale who... yeah. Opera lovers will enjoy Willy the Whale's rendition of "Largo al factotum", Canio's aria from _Pagliacci_, and his Lucia Sextet, the parts sung by individual bits of Willy's uvulae. It's narrated by [Nelson Eddy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Eddy), and he's also the sole voice behind all the singing (including a wicked falsetto for the ladies). It's delightful, and you can watch it [here](http://www.cornel1801.com/disney/Make-Mine-Music-1946/film9.html).
